# yafka
yet another kafka client

# Motivations

There are lots of kafka clients written in Go, but still 

* Go Native: [confluent-kafka-go](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go) is a cgo based wrapper client
* High Level API: [sarama](https://github.com/Shopify/sarama) is not easy to use for beginners of kafka

[kafka-go](https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go) has similar approaches but yafka tries to focus on High Level API
